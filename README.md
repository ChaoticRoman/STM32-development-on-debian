# Getting started with STM32 on Linux

## Requirements

On Debian install required tools:

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi stlink-tools make
```

## Build

```
make
```

## Upload using ST-LINK V2

```
make load
```

## Linker script `link.ld`

**TODO:**

* Understand it
* Should not be it modified if some RAM is used?
* What is this `LENGTH` below? Address size?

```
MEMORY {
  rom : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 0x10000
  ram : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x10000
}
```

## `bootstrap.s`

**TODO:** What is this for?
